\section{Proposed Nomenclature}

The proposal consists of a series of rules for writing a proteoform sequence with modifications.  The sequence written is the sequence in question, whether observed or hypothesized, as opposed to the canonical sequence. Amino acids not observed are excluded from the nomenclature. For example, N-terminal M cleavages are noted simply by not including the terminal M in the sequence.
